# Exercise 1
## Introduction
Hi! My name is Soha and I'm a Health Data Science master's student at UCSF. I completed my bachelor's degree in Human Biology at UCSD, with a concentration in Healthcare & Social Issues. I have some coding background, with one semester of introductory Python and two quarters of R through this program. 

In this course, I'm looking forward to learning more Python and learning how to apply it to a variety of data science problems. I'm also looking forward to learning how LLMs and generative AI work, since that's a topic I have a lot of questions about.

## About the Assignment
The goal of this assignment is to use basic Python concepts like functions, loops, and conditional statements to answer a variety of grading-based questions.

To run the program, you can either open the file using a codespace by going through datasci_223_soha > exercises/1-foundations > exercise.ipynb or clone the repository and open it in your IDE of choice. Clear any outputs and run all in a fresh virtual environment. This exercise has no dependencies besides Jupyter. 

You can also find a link to the file [HERE](https://github.com/sohashahidi/datasci_223_soha/blob/main/exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb).
